# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Task Details 

Design Selection:

I selected a Portfolio Website Design from Dribbble, opting for a minimalist design and a well-curated color theme. Below, you'll find a sample image showcasing the chosen UI design. This selection aims to create a sleek and professional aesthetic for the portfolio website.
